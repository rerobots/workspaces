Description
-----------

This workspace type has a Misty II Field Trial robot by [Misty Robotics](
https://www.mistyrobotics.com/). The robot is free to move inside a space that
resembles the inside of a modern office building.  Every workspace instance
includes an offboard host (x86_64 Linux) on the same network as the robot. There
are several webcams that provide various perspectives and that can be accessed
via standard device files `/dev/video0`, `/dev/video1`, etc. on the offboard
host. The workspace includes external speakers for audio-related tests, such as
localization.
