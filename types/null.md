Description
-----------

The `null` workspace type is equivalent to a single host VM or Linux
container-based environment as classically found in cloud computing
environments. That is, it lacks connections with sensors or actuators
prerequisite to be a robot.

This workspace type is primarily intended to support testing of rerobots
infrastructure, but it might be of independent interest.
