# fixed_misty2

## Description

This workspace type has a Misty II robot by [Misty Robotics](
https://www.mistyrobotics.com/). It is lifted, so the wheels are free to move
while the center of the body is fixed.  There is one webcam attached and visible
from the device file `/dev/video0`.  Every workspace instance includes an
offboard host (x86_64 Linux) on the same network as the robot.
