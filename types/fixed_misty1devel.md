fixed_misty1devel <small>(version 6)</small>
=================

Description
-----------

This workspace type has a Misty I Developer Edition by [Misty Robotics](
https://www.mistyrobotics.com/). It is lifted, so the wheels are free to move
while the center of the body is fixed.  There is one webcam attached and
visible from the device file `/dev/video0`.  Every workspace
instance includes an offboard host (x86_64 Linux) on the same network as the
robot.
