# fixed_misty1devel

## Description

This workspace type has a Misty I Developer Edition by [Misty Robotics](
https://www.mistyrobotics.com/). It is lifted, so the wheels are free to move
while the center of the body is fixed.  There is one webcam attached and
visible from the device file `/dev/video0`.  Every workspace
instance includes an offboard host (x86_64 Linux) on the same network as the
robot.

Note that the Misty I Developer Edition is superseded by [the Misty II Field
Trial robot](fixed_misty2fieldtrial).
